# zk-protocol #
A precise, clean and easy to understand description of the protocol used in ZKTeco devices.

**Check the [PyZatt lib](https://github.com/adrobinoga/pyzatt)!!!**

## Getting Started ##

This project is part of an effort to build an alternative for ZKTeco's Standalone devices, you should begin by reading the user manual and the Standalone SDK docs, that can be found in ZKTeco's SDKs Download page.

Then begin with the main page:

- [protocol.md](./protocol.md)

Protocol related operations are grouped in the following sections:

- [ex_data.md](sections/ex_data.md): Protocol for the exchange of large amounts of data.
- [terminal.md](sections/terminal.md): Protocol for procedures to get/set device parameters.
- [data-user.md](sections/data-user.md): Protocol to manage the users data.
- [data-record.md](sections/data-record.md): Protocol to manage records.
- [access.md](sections/access.md): Protocol to manage the access settings.
- [realtime.md](sections/realtime.md): Protocol of the realtime events.
- [other.md](sections/other.md): Other procedures.

## Develop ##

Currently this spec is intended for devices of the TFT series, but there's no reason to keep it that way.

Make contributions to the develop branch under a pull request.

Capture files of network traffic of documented tests are welcomed.

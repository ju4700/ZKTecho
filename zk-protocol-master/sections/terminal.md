## Connection ##

In this document only connection using TCP/IP is considered.

### Without Communication Key ###

To set a connection with the device we first need de ip address of the device, that can be manually set in the standalone machine.

First you need to setup a socket connection, using TCP/IP, with the given ip address and with the port 4370.

Then send a packet with the command `CMD_CONNECT`.

	packet(id=CMD_CONNECT)

Keep in mind that for this packet the session id and reply number, must be zero, since the session id hasn't been assigned by the machine, and the reply number starts at zero.

The device should reply with the reply code `CMD_ACK_OK`.

	packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

Keep in mind that the reply number must be the same of the sent packet(zero), but the session id is defined with this packet, the client should parse and store the session id from this reply packet.

After sending the connection command is acknowledged, set the SDKBuild parameter to 1 using a `CMD_OPTIONS_WRQ` command.

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_WRQ, data="SDKBuild=1\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

### With Communication Key ###

When a communication key is set in the device, and if the device doesn't receive the corresponding key, then it will reply with the reply code `CMD_ACK_UNAUTH`, that means that the connection hasn't been authorized.

To do this a packet with the command `CMD_AUTH` must be sent, the data field carries the communication key, the problem is that the key appears to be hashed, and the hash function it isn't known yet, but it seems that it depends on the session id of the machine reply, so currently there is no way to reproduce this procedure. Though this feature it isn't very useful, it only prevents other clients to send commands to the machine, but if someone have access to the network, it may still see all the trafic, since the communication it isn't encrypted, given that case, an attacker could capture the hashed value, discover the hashing function through disassembling, get the commkey and then send the correct hash, given a session id, to start a session and then send commands (like unlock door). **Therefore the network used for the system must be dedicated and kept away from intruders**.

## Disconnection ##

To terminate a connection with a device just send packet with command `CMD_EXIT`.

	> packet(id=CMD_EXIT)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

Keep in mind that the session id and reply number must be consistent with previous steps.

After that you may terminate the socket connection.

## Get Device Status ##

To request status info from device, a disable command `CMD_DISABLEDEVICE` must be sent first, after that the device should reply with the command `CMD_ACK_OK`, then send the command `CMD_GET_FREE_SIZES`.

The device should reply with a command with the code `CMD_ACK_OK` and a data structure of 92 bytes.

Finally send the enable command `CMD_ENABLEDEVICE`, the device should reply with the `CMD_ACK_OK` code.

	> packet(id=CMD_DISABLEDEVICE)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)
	> packet(id=CMD_GET_FREE_SIZES)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data=<status>)
	> packet(id=CMD_ENABLEDEVICE)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

Where **status** is the structure of 92 bytes with the relevant info, which has the following fields:

|SDK Value	|Name			|Description					|Position	|
|---		|---			|---						|---		|
|1		|admin count		|Number of administrators.			|48		|
|2		|user count		|Number of registered users.			|16		|
|3		|fp count		|Number of fingerprint templates on the machine.|24		|
|4		|pwd count		|Number of passwords.				|52		|
|5		|oplog count		|Number of operation records.			|40		|
|6		|attlog count		|Number of attendance records.			|32		|
|7		|fp capacity		|Fingerprint template capacity.			|56		|
|8		|user capacity		|User capacity.					|60		|
|9		|attlog capacity	|Attendance record capacity.			|64		|
|10		|remaining fp		|Remaining fingerprint template capacity.	|68		|
|11		|remaining user		|Remaining user capacity.			|72		|
|12		|remaining attlog	|Remaining attendance record capacity.		|76		|
|21		|face count		|Number of faces.				|80		|
|22		|face capacity		|Face capacity.					|88		|

**Note**: All the values are 4-Byte wide and stored in little endian format.

The full data structure looks like this:

|Offset(base 10)	|0		|4		|8		|12			|
|:---:			|:---:		|:---:		|:---:		|:---:			|
|**0**			|0		|0		|0		|0			|
|**16**			|user count	|0		|fp count	|0			|
|**32**			|attlog count	|0		|oplog count	|0			|
|**48**			|admin count	|pwd count	|fp capacity	|user capacity		|
|**64**			|attlog capacity|remaining fp	|remaining user	|remaining attlog	|
|**80**			|face count	|0		|face capacity	|

The zeroed bytes can be seen as reserved bytes, some of them are actually accessed with the values [13,20] in the SDK function.

## Device Time ##

Time is a very important parameter for access control, if the time is not set correctly the timezone settings will not work as expected.

### Get Time ###

To request the device time send a `CMD_GET_TIME` command.

	packet(id=CMD_GET_TIME)

The device should reply with `CMD_ACK_OK` code and a 4 byte integer with the device time, stored in little endian format.

	packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data=<enc_t>)

Where `enc_t` is calculated with the following formula:

```python
enc_t = ((year%100)*12*31+((month-1)*31)+day-1)*(24*60*60)+(hour*60+minutes)*60+seconds
```
Which is approximately the number of seconds since 29 Aug 1999.

So to decode the date from this number, the following Python snippet may be used:

```python
seconds = int(enc_t % 60)
minutes = int((enc_t/60.)%60)
hour = int((enc_t/(3600.))%24)
day = int(((enc_t/(3600.*24.))%31))+1
month = int(((enc_t/(3600.*24.*31.))%12))+1
year = int((enc_t/(3600.*24.)) / 365)+2000
```

### Set Time ###

To change time send a packet with the command `CMD_SET_TIME` with a 4 byte integer with the new time, stored in little endian format, in the same format given for the get time function.

After that the machine should reply with `CMD_ACK_OK`, to make changes take effect send a `CMD_REFRESHDATA` command to load the new value, the machine should reply with `CMD_ACK_OK`.

This procedure can be summarized as follows:

	> packet(id=CMD_SET_TIME, data=<enc_t>)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)
	> packet(id=CMD_REFRESHDATA)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

## Generic Requests ##

The general procedure to read/write a list of parameters, is:

1. Disable the device with a `CMD_DISABLEDEVICE` command.
2. Read/write a set of parameters.
3. Enable the device with a `CMD_ENABLEDEVICE` command.

### Generic Read of Parameters ###

Some parameters of the device can be requested with a separate command but there is a set of parameters that can be requested with the one command, `CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ`,  and an specific argument, which would be the name of the parameter.

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="<param name>\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="<param name>=<param value>\x00")

**Notes**:

- The param values are given in string format, that means that if a 1 is returned, it actually corresponds to `0x31`.
- Booleans are represented with "1" and "0".
- Integers are given as a string number in base 10.
- Some of these values may not be present on the machine, in that case the machine would reply with `CMD_ACK_ERROR`.

Here is a list of some parameters that can be requested using that format:

|Parameter name		|Returns	|
|---			|---		|
|~Platform		|Plaform name	|
|~ZKFPVersion		|Integer	|
|ZKFaceVersion		|-		|
|~OS			|-		|
|~ExtendFmt		|-		|
|ExtendOPLog		|-		|
|WorkCode		|Bool		|
|Language		|Integer	|
|BiometricType		|-		|
|FingerFunOn		|Bool		|
|~IsOnlyRFMachine	|Bool		|
|FaceFunOn		|Bool		|
|~OEMVendor		|Vendor name	|
|~DeviceName		|Device name	|
|MAC			|MAC address	|
|~SerialNumber		|Serial number	|
|~ProductTime		|Date string	|
|~PIN2Width		|Integer	|
|~IsABCPinEnable	|Bool		|
|~T9FunOn		|Bool		|

### Examples ###

1.Get platform(String):

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 12 00 00 00  0B 00 B9 E6 F3 8D 0C 00  PP.}............
	00000010: 7E 50 6C 61 74 66 6F 72  6D 00                    ~Platform.

The machine may reply:

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 1D 00 00 00  D0 07 71 4C F3 8D 0C 00  PP.}......qL....
	00000010: 7E 50 6C 61 74 66 6F 72  6D 3D 5A 45 4D 37 36 30  ~Platform=ZEM760
	00000020: 5F 54 46 54 00                                    _TFT.

2.Get Worcode(Bool):

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 11 00 00 00  0B 00 84 C2 F3 8D 0B 00  PP.}............
	00000010: 57 6F 72 6B 43 6F 64 65  00                       WorkCode.

The machine may reply:

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 13 00 00 00  D0 07 82 8A F3 8D 0B 00  PP.}............
	00000010: 57 6F 72 6B 43 6F 64 65  3D 30 00                 WorkCode=0.

### Get Serial Number ###

To request the serial number of the device, send:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~SerialNumber\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~SerialNumber=<serial number>\x00")

### Get Product Code ###

To request the product code, send:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~DeviceName\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~DeviceName=<device name>\x00")

### Get Card Function ###

This procedure comprises the request of two parameters:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~IsOnlyRFMachine\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~IsOnlyRFMachine=<is_rf>\x00")
	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~RFCardOn\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~RFCardOn=<card_on>\x00")

Where `is_rf` is a boolean variable, 1-Byte wide, that corresponds to 1 if the machine **only** supports RFID tags and 0 in the opposite case. The variable `card_on` is also a boolean variable, 1-Byte wide, that corresponds to 1 if the machine supports the RFID tags.

According to the SDK:

- The function returns 1 if the machine only supports the RF card.
- The function returns 2 if the machine supports the RF card and fingerprints.
- The function returns 0 if the machine doesn't support the RF card.

That means that the value may be calculated with the next formula:

	return value = card_on * (1 + not(is_rf))

### Get Vendor ###

Procedure to request the vendor name:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~OEMVendor\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~OEMVendor=<vendor name>\x00")

### Get Device String Info ###

Procedure to request the product time:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~ProductTime\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~ProductTime=yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS\x00")

Where the time can be easily parsed, consider the time to be in 24-hour format.

### Get Platform ###

Procedure to request the platform:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="~Platform\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="~Platform=<platform name>\x00")

Where the  `platform name` specifies the device platform.

### Get Device Info ###

This procedure it is performed in the same way that the Generic Read of Parameters:

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_RRQ, data="<param name>\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="<param name>=<param value>\x00")

This table is based on the SDK definitions.

### Set Device Info ###

This procedure is used to change parameters of the device (see table of Device Info Parameters).

	> packet(id=CMD_OPTIONS_WRQ, data="<parameter name>=<new value>\x00")
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)
	> packet(id=CMD_REFRESHOPTION)
		> packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK)

Also, keep in mind that some parameters are read only.

#### Examples ####

1.Changing Lock on timer(Integer):

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 11 00 00 00  0C 00 EB BB 84 C5 47 00  PP.}..........G.
	00000010: 4C 6F 63 6B 4F 6E 3D 35  00                       LockOn=5.

The machine may reply with `CMD_ACK_OK`.

2.Changing antipassback flag(Bool):

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 19 00 00 00  0C 00 60 22 84 C5 43 00  PP.}......`"..C.
	00000010: 41 6E 74 69 50 61 73 73  62 61 63 6B 4F 6E 3D 30  AntiPassbackOn=0
	00000020: 00                                                .

The machine may reply with `CMD_ACK_OK`.

## Get Firmware Version ##

To request the firmware version send a `CMD_GET_VERSION` command.

	packet(id=CMD_GET_VERSION)

The device should reply with a `CMD_ACK_OK` code and a data structure with the version tag and date of the firmware:

	packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="Ver <version tag>  <date>\x00")

Example:

	packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, data="Ver 6.81  Apr 28 2015\x00")

## Get Device State ##

To request the device current state send a `CMD_STATE_RRQ` command.

	packet(id=CMD_STATE_RRQ)

The device should reply with a `CMD_ACK_OK` code and the current device state, stored in the `session id` field in little endian format.

	packet(id=CMD_ACK_OK, session id=<state>)

Where the state may have one of the following values:

|Value	|Description				|
|---	|---					|
|0	|Waiting state.				|
|1	|Fingerprint registration state.	|
|2	|Fingerprint identification state.	|
|3	|Menu access state.			|
|4	|Busy.					|
|5	|Waiting for card writing.		|

**Example**:

Reply example

	00000000: 50 50 82 7D 08 00 00 00  D0 07 F6 F7 02 00 37 00  PP.}..........7.

In this case the device is at state 2.

# ZKTeco Employee Attendance Management - Implementation Verification

## ‚úÖ Your Requirements Analysis

### **Primary Goal**: "Main focus of the software is to manage the attendance of the employees"

### **Workflow Requirements**:
1. ‚úÖ **Device Discovery**: "I plug the zkteco machine in my local network and the software should be able to find it"
2. ‚úÖ **Employee Management**: "From the software I should be able to register new employees, delete and update their respective fingerprints"
3. ‚úÖ **Separated Processes**: "Adding new employee in the software is a separate thing - I add name, salary per month and necessary details"
4. ‚úÖ **Fingerprint Registration**: "Then later register a fingerprint for that user so that his salary and other stuff gets calculated from the day of added fingerprint"
5. ‚úÖ **Minimalistic**: "No need employee email, department, card number - software can be minimalistic but functional"

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### **1. Device Discovery & Connection** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**How it works**:
- Automatic network scanning for ZKTeco devices
- Scans common IP ranges: 192.168.1.200-210, 192.168.0.200-210
- Default ZKTeco IPs: 192.168.1.201, 192.168.0.201
- Real-time device status checking
- Port 4370 communication

**Code Location**: `/src/lib/deviceDiscovery.ts`

### **2. Employee Management** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Minimalistic Employee Model**:
```typescript
Employee {
  name: string              // ‚úÖ Required
  phone: string            // ‚úÖ Optional
  monthlySalary: number    // ‚úÖ Required - salary per month
  fingerprintEnrolled: boolean    // ‚úÖ Tracks fingerprint status
  fingerprintDate: Date          // ‚úÖ Salary calculation start date
  deviceUserId: string          // ‚úÖ Links to ZKTeco device
  // ‚ùå No email, department, card number (as requested)
}
```

**Code Location**: `/src/models/Employee.ts`

### **3. Device User Registration** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Workflow**:
1. Add employee in software (name, salary, phone)
2. Click "Add to Device" - registers user on ZKTeco
3. Employee goes to device and enrolls fingerprint
4. System automatically updates `fingerprintEnrolled` and `fingerprintDate`
5. Salary calculations start from fingerprint enrollment date

**Code Location**: `/src/app/api/device/users/route.ts`

### **4. Fingerprint Enrollment Tracking** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Process**:
- Employee added to software ‚ûú Not enrolled yet
- Employee registered on device ‚ûú Ready for fingerprint
- Fingerprint enrolled on device ‚ûú `fingerprintEnrolled = true`
- `fingerprintDate` set ‚ûú Salary calculations begin

**Code Location**: `/src/app/api/attendance/sync/route.ts`

### **5. Attendance Management** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Features**:
- Real-time sync from ZKTeco device
- Check-in/Check-out logic (alternating)
- Attendance history tracking
- Monthly attendance reports

**Code Location**: `/src/models/Attendance.ts`

### **6. Salary Calculation** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Logic**:
- Monthly salary √∑ days in month = daily rate
- Actual working days √ó daily rate = calculated salary
- Calculations start from `fingerprintDate` (not employee creation date)
- Bonus/deduction support

**Code Location**: `/src/app/api/salaries/route.ts`
